<!-- Filename: Help4.x:Guided_Tours:_New_or_Edit_Tour / Display title: Guided Tours: New or Edit Tour -->

## Description

This screen is used to add a new or edit an existing Tour, usually using a Wysiwyg editor. The default editor is TinyMCE but if other editors are installed the default editor may be set to something else for the site as a whole or for individual users.

A tour must include a least one step. Once a tour has been newly created, go to the tours list and select '0' from the Steps column.

The first step of the tour is automatically made of the tour title and description.

## How to Access

Select **System -> Manage panel -> Guided Tours** from the Administrator menu.

To add a Tour:

- Click the **New** toolbar button

To edit a Tour:

- Select a **Title** from the list

## Form Fields

- **Title**. The Title for this tour. If the title is a language key, an aditional field is shown, representing the translation of that key for the user's locale.
- **Identifier.** A unique identifier for the tour. On 'save', or 'copy', a value is provided by default. A suggested format would be ''authorname-tourname'', ''companyname-tourname'' or ''domain-tourname''. This identifier has multiple purposes: start a tour from anywhere (not only from the Guided Tours module), differentiate tours coming from different origins, and on multilingual sites, it dictates the language file names structure.

### Edit Tour tab

#### Left Panel

- **URL**. The mandatory relative path from where the tour starts.
   For instance, to start a tour from the tour's page, enter *administrator/index.php?option=com_guidedtours&view=tours*.
- **Description**. This is where you enter the description of the tour. Joomla includes 3
   editors, the default **Editor - TinyMCE** is shown here. The tour description can be a
   language key. When this is the case, a secondary field presents the translated description of that key for the user's locale.
   The CMS Content dropdown list provides access to **Media**.

   toggle between **TinyMCE** and **Editor - None**.

## Quick Tips

- There are 2 methods to insert an image into the tour's description using the TinyMCE editor.
  1. The **CMS Content** dropdown list provides access to the **Media** screen that lets you browse image files and upload images.
  2. The 'Insert' dropdown list is a simple form for which you need to know the image url. It is used for external images.
- There are 2 ways tours can be created for multilingual environments:
  1. Create one tour for each supported language.
  2. Create one tour only for all languages and use language keys for title and description.
- Use **GUIDEDTOUR** in language keys as a convention wherever language
  keys are used (for title and description).
