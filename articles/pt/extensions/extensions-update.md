- Only extensions which support the Joomla! update system will be listed
  in this screen. If you use extensions which do not support the new
  update system or you are not sure, consult the extension developer's
  website.
- It is critical to keep your extensions up-to-date. Failure to do so
  may expose a vulnerability in your Joomla! installation which can be
  exploited by hackers.
- It is recommended to backup your Joomla! installation files and
  database before attempting to update extensions or the Joomla!
  installation itself. This will ensure that you can restore your
  Joomla! installation to its previous state if the update fails or
  causes unexpected results.
